Combat Tag Reloaded
=============
Do you hate it when you are winning a fight and your opponent logs out, or when someone runs in to a safezone? Then use Combat Tag Reloaded, a plugin that stops PvP logging and entering a safezone in combat.

##Features
* Marks someone in combat if they are fighting and unmarks them when they aren't
* Applies a punishment if someone logs off in combat to discourage combat-logging
  * Spawn an npc with armor to take the player's place until they log on again
  * Instantly Kill them when they log off
* Prevents you from entering a worldedit no-pvp region when in combat to prevent safezoning

##Requirements
* Java 7

###Optional
* [Citizens2](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/citizens/) if you want to spawn npcs
* [WorldGuard](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/worldguard/) to check for worldedit no-pvp zone
