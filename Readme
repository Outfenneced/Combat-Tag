This is the enhanced version of CombatTag.

Enhancements over vanilla CombatTag:
    Temporary ban of configurable seconds when logging out during combat.
    Player ban duration multiplies by two for each subsequent incident of combat logging.
    The player ban duration is reset to the default configured temporary ban after a day (86400 seconds).

CombatTag:
	Combat tag is a plugin for bukkit which prevents pvp loggers from getting away with logging.
	This plugin was originally made by marinating. 
Config file explanation:
	TagTime: duration of tag (from the time the player is hit by another player)

-- Setup --

Look at the setup instructions here:

        http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/combat-tag/pages/setup/

-- Post-setup configuration --

Look at the settings manifest here:
        http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/combat-tag/pages/config-file/

And, to these configuration instructions, there are extra settings:

- tempBanSeconds:
  Integer, positive (zero or negative values have no effect)
  
  Players who log out are banned for this amount of time (default 10 seconds),
  if they have been damaged or if they have damaged someone else within the
  time specified in the setting Tag-Duration.
  
  The tempban is implemented as a volatile (in-RAM) list that is not persisted
  between server restarts, and any user in this list whose tempban has not
  expired, is auto-kicked with a message.

-- Documentation for other relevant settings --

- Tag-Duration:
  (Yes, the capitalization is retarded. It wasn't me)
  Integer, positive (zero or negative values will cause a malfunction)
  
  This is the amount of seconds between the moment of a a hit/damage and the
  expiration of the "tag" (that is, when the player was "tagged" as in combat). 

- npcDespawnTime:
  Integer (-1 or positive).
  
  This is the amount of seconds between a player logging out and his NPC
  despawning automatically.  If -1, it will never despawn.
